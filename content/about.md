title: Wecome to GentleR

Welcome to GentleR! The place where no question is too silly, no problem is too large and no language other than R will do! 	
	
We are a group of statisticians and researchers who meet every week, for one golden hour, to discuss all things R, statistics and research in general. Everyone is welcome to attend and the goal is to workshop through issues that people are having with R or statistics in a friendly, informative and non-judgmental way. 
	
Some topics you might like to bring along will include:

 - How do I get R to ....?
 - What sort of analysis should I use for my research?
 - I just found this R package, what's it all about?
 - Where should I look for support on how to ...?
 - I've been using this cool package and I want to tell you about it!

In fact, we may have guest speakers from time to time who will present on a variety of interesting topics. These will be advertised on the blog in advance. And, if you'd like to be one of our presenters (or know someone who would), then let us know!

No problem is too big, no question is too small! The goal is to work together to make us better R users... Although new collaborations have been know to form in such environments in the past too... 

Sessions run every Tuesday at 9am in room 5.57 of the Ingkarni Wardli building, University of Adelaide, North Terrace Campus (unless otherwise stated), starting on the 19$^{th}$ of February, 2019.

We look forward to seeing you there!
