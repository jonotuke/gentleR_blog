The program git gives you the ability to take snapshots of your work and at a later date get stuff back. No more files named

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
analysis_final.R
analysis_28thFeb.R
analysis_I_hope_this_is_the_end.R
```

Installing `git` depends on your system, try looking at 

<https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>

or

searching

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
installing git on ??
```

## Terminal

The main process for the terminal are:

1. Change directory to the folder with your work

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd my_directory
```

2. Set up git in that folder with

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git init
```

3. Now to take a snapshot, we do two things, first we let git know if any files should be snapshotted with 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add myfile.R
```

4. When we are ready to take a snapshot, then we run

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git commit -am "Messsage about where I am upto"
```


## Built in Rstudio git GUI

Most of this can be done with the built in git GUI in Rstudio. If you open a project with git already running, then you should be a git tab

Click on this and then on `Commit` to open the following dialog box

The process is now just:

- select the files you want to save in the top left, 
- Add a commit message in the top right, and
- click Commit. 

All done. 

## Github desktop

A more polished app to help is the github desktop app - this is here:

Everything else in git is best found by asking someone, or searching the internet.
