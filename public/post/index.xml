      <description>Welcome to GentleR! The place where no question is too silly, no problem is too large and no language other than R will do!
We are a group of statisticians and researchers who meet every week, for one golden hour, to discuss all things R, statistics and research in general. Everyone is welcome to attend and the goal is to workshop through issues that people are having with R or statistics in a friendly, informative and non-judgmental way.</description>
