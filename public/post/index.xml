This is a great starting point for anyone new to R who would like to learn the tidyverse. Also a good recap for old users as well.

      <description>Hi Everyone,
As you can (possibly) see, this blog has been created using blogdown. Blogdown is an R package that, Rmarkdown style, takes your info and creates a blog with them! Cool huh? So, as a complete newby to this wonderful bit of awesome, I’m going to write down the steps you need to write a post for this blog!… Possibly so I can remind myself how to do it later… but also so that you can see some steps if you’d like to try and write your own!</description>

      <description>Welcome to GentleR! The place where no question is too silly, no problem is too large and no language other than R will do!
We are a group of statisticians and researchers who meet every week, for one golden hour, to discuss all things R, statistics and research in general. Everyone is welcome to attend and the goal is to workshop through issues that people are having with R or statistics in a friendly, informative and non-judgmental way.</description>
