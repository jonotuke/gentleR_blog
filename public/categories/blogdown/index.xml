      <description>Hi Everyone,
As you can (possibly) see, this blog has been created using blogdown. Blogdown is an R package that, Rmarkdown style, takes your info and creates a blog with them! Cool huh? So, as a complete newby to this wonderful bit of awesome, I’m going to write down the steps you need to write a post for this blog!… Possibly so I can remind myself how to do it later… but also so that you can see some steps if you’d like to try and write your own!</description>
