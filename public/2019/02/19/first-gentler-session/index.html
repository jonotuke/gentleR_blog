<p>What a fantastic start to GentleR! We had a room full of over 20 R enthusiasts from long-term users through to newcomers wanting to know more. We had representation across so many levels and fields, from PhD students to Professors, and from Spatial Sciences, Biology and Ecology to Chemical Engineering, Economics and even Maths and Stats! While everyone in the room professed to knowing how to do linear regression in R, only about a quarter of us had written packages and/or built shiny apps.</p>
<p>Discussion began with the question of how we all want the group to run and how we could best support each other. We have set up a Slack channel for you all to continue the R chat - just search for # GentleR. We also noted that to get the best out of the group meetings, it would be great for members to bring along their laptops to run code, give demonstrations and share error messages!</p>
<p>With the explosion of R over the past few years, a number of members talked of the difficulty in knowing where to start and how to differentiate between the good packages and the … less useful ones. For this reason, we have set up (or will do soon) a resources page on the blog site - one for core references (including some of the books Jono mentioned like R for Data Science by Hadley), and another for us to post some of our favourite packages.</p>
<p>It was finally time for Jono to take the floor and take us through how and why we should all be using R Projects! (Something he’s been telling me for months, and I will definitely be getting on to!) We also discussed version control and back-up via Git, and you can look forward to <strong>A Gentle Intro to Git</strong>, by Sam and Jono sometime in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Other useful tips to take away from our first session:</p>
<ul>
<li>always comment your code</li>
<li>use Projects to avoid procrastinating</li>
<li>know (or set) your shortcuts, and</li>
<li>don’t forget to check out the vignettes and R Cheat Sheets!</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a great first session, and we’re looking forward to seeing you all again on Tuesday, same time (9am) same place (IW 5.57).</p>
